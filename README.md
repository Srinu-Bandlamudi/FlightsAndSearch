## Project Overview

This is a microservice architecture project designed for managing flight bookings. It includes the following key features:

- **Inter-Service Communication**: Utilizes Axios for seamless communication between microservices.
- **Message Broker Integration**: Employs RabbitMQ for handling service downtime and managing message queues.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implements rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.
- **Logging**: Uses Morgan logger for HTTP request logging.
- **Flight Search**: Allows searching for flights based on various filters.
- **Email Notifications**: Sends emails using Nodemailer and manages pending emails with Node-cron.
- **Centralized API Handling**: Features an API Gateway for centralized management and rate limiting of API requests.

     ```
   - Inside the `src/config` folder, create a file `config.json` with the following content:
     ```json
     {
       "development": {
         "username": "<YOUR_USER_NAME>",
         "password": "<YOUR_DB_PASSWORD>",
         "database": "Flights_Serach_DB_DEV",

         "dialect": "mysql"
       }
     }
     ```

## Database Design for FlightsAndSearch_Service

- **Tables:**
  - Airplane
  - Flight
  - Airport
  - City

- **Relationships:**
  - A Flight belongs to an Airplane, but one airplane can be used in multiple flights.
  - A city has many airports, but an airport belongs to one city.
  - One airport can have many flights, but a flight belongs to one airport.

### Table Schemas

- **City:**
  - `id`, `name`, `created_at`, `updated_at`

- **Airport:**
  - `id`, `name`, `address`, `city_id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
  - Relationship: City has many Airports, and Airport belongs to a City (one-to-many).

  ```bash
  npx sequelize model:generate --name Airport --attributes name:String,address:String,cityId:integer
